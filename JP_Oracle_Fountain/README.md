# JP_Oracle_Fountain

Project Motivation and Overview:
The Oracle Fountain is a IoT smart indoor water feature with Lighting and Sound components that would create Tranquil and Relaxing Ambiance for interior spaces. The fountain would have 3 main modes: 2 Water (high, low) Levels, Lighting for atmosphere (nighttime) and Sound (Looping soundscapes), Environment sensor with internet dashboard control/connectivity.

Minimum Features:
  • Waterfall pump,  LED light show
  • Dashboard
  • Minimum button control TOF
  • 3D Printed Housing, with one upper waterfall ring

Desired Features:
  •  MP3 player with speaker
  •  3D Printed Housing, 1 upper waterfall ring
  •  Button less interface/controls (ToF)

Stretch Goal Features:
  • Phone App subscription for sound loops and additional content *
  • Auto and Sleep Mode
  • Patent, and produce for market

Anticipated Components:
  • *TOF sensors (at least 1), small board w/ P2, water pump, relay, neopixel ring  BME
  • 3D Printed sections: Base, top ring, LED module (top)
  • Waterfall components: Tubing, connectors, water diffusers 
  • Electrical wiring, power supply (s)

Concerns and Considerations (Project Risks and Potential Mitigation's)
  •  getting TOF sensors to work properly for controls
  •  3D printed housing functional for waterfall feature. *3D design will center around 3D Printing footprint (base printing size/area)
  •  Automated modes, sleep
  •  Dashboard/bluetooth/code-red functions

Other Information:
*OLED may/may not be used depending on design build. 
The Capstone design will be built to emphasis IoT features, the MVP  production version will be refit with minimum E-components to accommodate a Starter Model not requiring P2 programming/connection.
