The Oracle Fountain is a IoT smart indoor water feature with Lighting and Sound components that would create Tranquil and Relaxing Ambiance for interior spaces. The fountain has 3 main modes: Waterfall feature, Crystal Ball Lighting for atmosphere (nighttime) and Sound (Looping soundscapes), Environment BME sensor with internet dashboard control/connectivity.

Ativating the modes are simple and elegant: 
The touch sensor is hidden inside the housing with just a fingertip size hole to access the button and toggles the Waterfall On Off also activating NeoPixel Waterfall panel.
The ToF has 4 levels (modes) with corresponding Neopixel (x4) color changes with each toggle:
1. Level 1- Crystal Ball on (Cyan), Crystal Ball off (Yellow)
2. Level 2- MP3 Player Tracks on (Turqoise) tracks off (Magenta)
3. Level 3- MP3 Player Volume on (Blue) tracks off (Green)
4. Level 4- Neopixels Off (for dark or stealth usage)
